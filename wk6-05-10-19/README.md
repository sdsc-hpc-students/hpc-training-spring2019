# HPC Training:  Spring 2019
## WEEK 6: 5/10/19

## TOPIC:  Intro to MPI 
## PRESENTED BY: Dr. Mahidhar Tatineni (mahidhar  at  sdsc.edu)

## READING AND PRESENTATIONS:
* [MPI Presentation](./SCC_MPI.pdf)

## TASKS:
Note: These are the same projects that you were asked to do for the OpenMP topic.
You can use the code found in this repository:
Tarfile: [hpc.mpi.tar](hpc.mpi.tar)
Source: [hpc.mpi](hpc.mpi)

1. Compile and execute the 'hello-mpi.c and hello-cpuid.c' examples source codes on your laptop. (if MPI runs on your laptop)
2. Compile and execute the 'hello-mpi.c and hello-cpuid.c' example source codes on your laptop (if MPI runs on your laptop)
3. Compile and execute the 'hello-mpi.c and hello-cpuid.c' example source codes on Comet and run it as a batch job. 
4. Write a small program to perform a matrix-vector operation and then parallelize the code with OpenMP. Solve the exercise invloving the Hilbert matrix described at the end of the presentation slides.

## TASKS:
1. Compile and execute the 'hello, world' examples source code on your laptop.
2. Compile and execute the 'hello, shared memory world' example source code on your laptop.
3. Compile and execute the 'hello, shared memory world' example source code on Comet and run it as a batch job. 
4. Write a small program to perform a matrix-vector operation and then parallelize the code with OpenMP. Solve the exercise invloving the Hilbert matrix described at the end of the presentation slides.

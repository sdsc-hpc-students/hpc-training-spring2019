# HPC Training:  Spring 2019
Directory template for Traning Session Work.

Clone the training session repository, and then place a
copy of the directory called
``` 
hwks
```
into your comet work space:

/oasis/scratch/comet/USERNAME/temp_project/hwks

the location and name of the directory will be read 
by a script, so please use lower case. You can add 
subdirs/etc. The name of each director is the same
one used for the presentations.

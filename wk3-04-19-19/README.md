2. Rules of engagement: 
     - Turning in work (in general):  
          - Put all your work under a directory called hpc-training
          - Create a directory called week3, …, week (weeks 3 to 10)
          - Dev/run code from that directory; we’ll let you know if that changes
          - To give you credit for your efforts, we’ll check your files/data/etc. 
     - Feel free to work with others as a team. 
     - Make sure you run all the tests and examples in your home directories.
